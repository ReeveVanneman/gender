<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Haruka_Ayase" title="Haruka Ayase">Haruka Ayase</a> - Girl (nameless; seen 22 November 2007): A girl who suddenly appeared before Jiro whilst he was celebrating his birthday alone. After a few hours, she stated that she had to go and vanished again. She seems to be a notable glutton. Her looks and eating habits were the model for the cyborg who later appeared to him. She seems to have a hidden agenda of her own, though...</li>
<li>Haruka Ayase - Cyborg Girl (nameless; seen 22 November 2008 to sometime before 7 April 2009): The cyborg who the future Jiro sent back in time to protect his younger self from a terrible fate. She has superhuman strength and speed, can show holograms through her eyes, and can reproduce the past through this. She can shock people through electrical charge from her skin and eyes, and can also imitate people's voices perfectly after only hearing them once. She appears to be just like a normal person, down to her ability to eat. Drinking alcohol causes malfunctions in her system. She doesn't like being called a robot. After Jiro's death, she was preserved in a museum, then put up for auction in the 22nd century. Her conception and subsequent portrayal was intended to be similar to the behavior of cyborgs in the Terminator series, as a sort of homage as well as parody.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Haruka Ayase - Future Girl (nameless; from the 22nd Century): After acquiring the Cyborg Girl (whom she has a close resemblance to), she learns about its past, and travels back into 2007 where she meet Jiro (hence giving him a memory of her into 2008), and later into the year (not made clear) where Tokyo was devastated by an earthquake, so that she can marry Jiro and spend her life with him.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Keisuke_Koide" title="Keisuke Koide">Keisuke Koide</a> - Jiro Kitamura (the 'boku' of the title): A university student who has bought a present for himself and gone to eat spaghetti at the same restaurant every year for his birthday. What he studies is unclear, although he attends lectures on mathematics. He has a part-time job at a hamburger shop. His birthplace was in a small village in the mountains, although it was destroyed by an earthquake which led to the dispersal of all its residents. Future Jiro became a millionaire through a lottery ticket he had originally purchased. However, the thought of the accident which left him disabled (a random shooting at the same restaurant) still weighed on him heavily, and he decided to send back a cyborg to change his younger self's fate. When the present Jiro grows old and dies, a waxwork model of him is preserved in a museum alongside the cyborg he created.</li></ul>
